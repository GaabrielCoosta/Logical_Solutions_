# *ü¶óPlatform Curso em V√≠deo*

All exercises done during the three Python 3 courses in the Video Course (World 1, 2 and 3). The course that introduced me to the world of programming. I started it without knowing anything about the area and today I understand programming logic and algorithms, as well as how to program in Python. In total, 115 exercises were performed.
